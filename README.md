# october date is dating system which is the amount of days since 10/1/2021


## this started as a joke back in october of 2021 when i didn't want to leave october (my favorite month) 

## bash installation one liner

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozzyisgreat/october-date/main/octdate.py -o /bin/octdate; chmod +x /bin/octdate; echo "done! type octdate to view the current october date"


*as of writing this it is october 232* 


*also i challenged myself to implement this in every language i could*
